        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. The word diet often implies the use of
        specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons. Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and
        essential fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Dietary
        habits and choices play a significant role in the quality of life, health and longevity.</p>

        <h2 class="nutrition-title">Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>
            Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates – complex and simple. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest; complex carbs take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.
            
            Complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing energy, they contain little nutritional value.For this reason, you should look to primarily consume complex carbohydrates. Some foods to consider adding to your diet include whole-grains, oats, beans, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.

    <div class="nutrition-info">
        <h2 class="nutrition-title">Protein</h2>
        <p>
            The majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. The reason why protein is so important is that, it plays a key role in recovery and repair. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses which cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. In order for the damage to be repaired, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.

            Protein is found most highly in animal produce such as lean meats, eggs & dairy. It can also be found in smaller quantities in foods such as seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, and soy.

    <div class="nutrition-info">
        <h2 class="nutrition-title">Fats</h2>
        <p>
            Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.

            While fats can have a positive impact on health, there are several types of fat – some of which are of greater benefit than others. While saturated fats are not as harmful as once believed, focus primarily on unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), oils (olive, peanut, sesame), and soy products (tofu, soy milk)

    </div>

    <h1 class="title">Foods to Limit</h1>
    
    <div class="nutrition-info">
        <p>While you should include a variety of foods in your diet, there are some you should limit.</p>
        <h2 class="nutrition-title">Foods to limit include:</h2>
        <ul class="foods">
            <li><span>Alcohol: </span>Alcohol can negatively affect your ability to build muscle and lose fat, especially if you consume it in excess.</li>
            <li><span>Added sugars: </span>These offer plenty of calories but few nutrients. Foods high in added sugars include candy, cookies, doughnuts, ice
            cream, cake and sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda and sports drinks.</li>
            <li><span>Deep-fried foods: </span>These may promote inflammation and — when consumed in excess — disease. Examples include fried fish, french fries, onion
            rings, chicken strips and cheese curds.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top:50px">In addition to limiting these, you may also want to avoid certain foods before going to the gym that can slow digestion and cause stomach upset during your workout.</p>
        
        <p>These include:</p>

        <ul class="foods">
            <li><span>High-fat foods: </span>High-fat meats, buttery foods and heavy sauces or creams.</li>
            <li><span>High-fiber foods: </span>Beans and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower.</li>
            <li><span>Carbonated beverages: </span>Sparkling water or diet soda.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h1 class="title">Bodybuilding Supplements</h1>
    
    <div class="nutrition-info">
        <p>Many bodybuilders take some dietary supplements.</p>
        <h2 class="nutrition-title">The bodybuilding supplements include:</h2>
        <ul class="foods">
            <li><span>Whey protein: </span>Consuming whey protein powder is an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake.</li>
            <li><span>Creatine: </span>Creatine provides your muscles with the energy needed to perform an additional rep or two. While there are many brands
            of creatine, look for creatine monohydrate as it’s the most effective.</li>
            <li><span>Caffeine: </span>Caffeine decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder. It’s found in pre-workout supplements, coffee or tea.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A multi-vitamin and mineral supplement may be helpful if you’re limiting your calorie intake in an effort to reduce body fat during your cutting phase.</p>
